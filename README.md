1. Optimized for cmp 50HX,
2. After optimization, the full power consumption is 500Mh. It is recommended that 66% power consumption be controlled within 400-420MH computing power,
3. The default full power consumption is 200Mh, and the optimization for cmp 50HX is improved by 250%
4.30HX and 40HX need to be tested by themselves,
5. The development fee is charged for 54 seconds every 30 minutes,
It is not easy to develop chicken blood tools. Please understand...

1.针对cmp 50HX优化，
2.优化后满功耗500Mh，建议66%功耗，能控制在400-410MH算力，

3.默认满功耗200Mh，针对cmp 50HX优化提升250%.

4.30HX,40HX需要自行测试，

5.开发费每30分钟抽54秒手续费，

  开发鸡血工具不易，请理解.....
